# CS-210: Programming Languages
# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project consisted of working at Chada Tech with a client Corner Grocer that requires a program that analyzes text records that are generated throughout the day. The records show a list of items at which the items are purchased from opening to close for their store. Corner Grocer is interested in rearranging their produce section and asked for a program that will meet their requirements while maintaining functionality. The program will help show the list of all items purchased in a day along with the number of times each item was purchased, the number representing how many times a specific item was purchased, and produces a text-based histogram listing all the times purchased in the day. 
# What did you do particularly well?
Within working on the project, I made sure to create comments to clarify every variable and organize every function with a description. 
# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Some improvements that can be made would be the cases or the error messages; The cases only utilize the user input and executes the function with CallIntFunc. I use a switch case and get error runtime but it can be improved by creating conditions for an error.
# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging pieces to write were the histogram, I researched how to implement it on C++ and also color for the display of the asterisks. I utilized the help from visual studio to guide me in creating the line reading and format. Also, integrating with Python was troublesome as I kept getting an error regarding the Python DL files but overcame it after adding the files.
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Integrating C++ with Python is a transferable skill. Integrating can help keep functions on Python which is easier to write it in my opinion.
# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I created white space to give good readability and made comments to help a reader with variable names. Descriptions are made at the start of each function.
